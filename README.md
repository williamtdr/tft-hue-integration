# tft-hue-integration

quick and dirty solution to tie up room lights to events in an active teamfight tactics game, using the [riot live client data api](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#game-client-api_live-client-data-api).

see `realtime-tft-monitor.mjs` for the class that talks to the server and parses out the events.

does not support normal league. many items TODO.
